# Vocabulary Learner
## Python script which uses Google's text to speech to teach vocabulary incorporating audio

How to use:
Run
python routes.py
point your browser (works best on Chrome or Safari) to 0.0.0.0:5000

When prompted choose a user name (this names the file where your work is stored)

Upload a unicode csv with the words you want to learn in the first column and their meanings in the right column (no headers).
The easiest way to make this csv is using Google Sheets. You can upload a list of the words you want to learn.
Then use the GoogleTranslate command to get simple translations. Many of these will probably be a little off but you can 
fix them as you go along.

When you notice mistakes in the data you can edit the words in the program. This won't effect anything.
